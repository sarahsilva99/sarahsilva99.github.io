#Project
My journey with this project has been up and down. This year was my first time coding. It was scary having to learn a new language, but it was also very exciting. In the beginning, I hated code. I couldn't understand why I wasn't getting it and then something clicked towards the middle of the semester. I think it was becauase this project was brought to my attention. I thought it was very cool that we would be designing and coding our own websites. 

When designing my site, I split it up into multiple parts. As I started coding, more ideas continued to pop in my head. The firt thing I started designing was my home page. I wanted my svg to move in a continuous cycle. It took me around 3 days to finally get what I wanted. After the home page was done, I basically started creating the layot for the entire site; how to navigate it, what should go where, what art should I use? During this entire process, I think I changed my mind about things, hundreds of times, and I think it made my site better. 

In conclusion, I had a blast with this project. It was a lot of work, but it really pushed me out of my comfort zone. I worked really hard on this project and am, truly, proud of it.
