        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p> Hi! My name is Sarah.</p>
    <p>I am a 20 year old graphic design major, currently attending the University of Massachuesetts Dartmouth.
    For most of my life, I have lived in my hometown Mahwah, New Jersey. I grew up with my two sisters and lovely parents.
    I have loved art ever since I was a kid, but it wasn't the only interest that caught my attention. Soccer became my 
    second love and I'm proud to say that I continue to practice, both, today. I am on the school team and I couldn't be happier. 
    <br> Growing up, I never had a specific style that I was completely drawn to. As I grew older, I continued to practice and experiment to 
    find my media. It wasn't until high school, junior year, that I took my first graphic design class and found my true calling. 
    Today, I am a designer, creator, and artist. <br> In my free time, I enjoy playing sports, listening to music, 
    making videos, and going on as many adventures as I can with friends and family. <br> Being a creator has become a huge 
    part of my life and I don't know who I would be without it.
    </p>
